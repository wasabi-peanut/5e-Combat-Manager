A spreadsheet for Dungeons and Dragons 5e that lets you easily search huge databases of spells and monsters. Also allows you to add custom spells/monsters. Features an automatic dice roller, too.

## What is it?
It's a spreadsheet that helps you manage combat. But it's not your standard D&D spreadsheet. It uses three different databases of spells and monsters along with easy search boxes which allow you to have any stat, at any time, no matter what your PC's do.
## What features does it have?
Here's a list:
* Monster lookup (gives you AC, HP, Ability Scores, damage dice formula and automatic damage rolls)
* Spell Lookup (gives you description, level, range, upgrade details, damage, automatic damage roll, saving throw, school of magic, duration)
* Initiative tracker (automatically sorted by initiative roll)
* Stat-tracking grid (tracks XP, AC, HP, and conditions of your PCs or monsters)
* Handy reference links
 * Open MM to correct page
 * Search Roll20 Compendium, D20 SRD, or Google for the spell
* Open 4d10 (0000-1000) Random Magical Effect PDF
* Links to Name Gens:
 * Cowboy names
 * Fantasy names
 * Place names
 * Modern English names
* Onboard name gen
 * Uses Kerbal names (e.g Thompfrey) with optional "Kerman" surname.
 * Good for KSP players or non-KSP players, as they make memorable names.
* Name chart
 * Can be populated from an external source, the onboard generator or by you.
 * Has spaces for descriptions of characters, so you don't reuse names.
 * Conditional formatting makes clear which names are available and which are taken.
 
**The spreadsheet is well-annotated with notes. Feel free to ask any questions here.**
 


## TL;DR and download
[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByMhRbTvKiaCaEtydDNRdHdJOEk)'s the spreadsheet. I recommend you clone it to your drive and use it there. Works best when viewed with Google Sheets (It's compatible with Excel, it just looks ugly).
