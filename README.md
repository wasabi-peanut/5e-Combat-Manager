## What is it?
It's a spreadsheet that helps you manage combat. It uses complete databases of spells and lets you search them easily. It has smart status indicators, an initiative tracker, a map editor, and a NPC tracker that lets you store faces!, names and descriptions for up to 190 NPC characters. Everything is easily expandable with some knowledge of spreadsheets.
## What features does it have?
Here's a list:
* Monster lookup (gives you AC, HP, Ability stat block, damage dice formula and automatic damage rolls)
* Spell Lookup (gives you description, level, range, upgrade details, damage, automatic damage roll, saving throw, school of magic, duration)
* Initiative tracker (characters involved in an encounter are automatically sorted by initiative roll)
* Stat-tracking grid (tracks XP, AC, HP, and conditions of your PCs or monsters)
* Handy reference links
   * Open MM PDF to correct page
   * Search Roll20 Compendium, D20 SRD, or Google for the spell
* Onboard composite face generator
   * Generate hundreds of faces automatically, and customize important characters with some really cool conditional formatting
   * Generation and storage of randomized faces per NPC
* Donjon Name gen linker
    * Allows you to select a type, a subtype category, and a subtype and links you straight to the donjon page.
* Onboard name gen
   * Uses Kerbal name parts (e.g Thompfrey) with optional "Kerman" surname.
   * Allows for customization of name parts, and last name parts
* Name chart
   * Can be populated from an external source, the onboard generator or by you.
   * Has spaces for descriptions of characters, so you don't reuse names.
   * Conditional formatting makes clear which names are available and which are taken.
* Broadcast sheet
   * Currently supports showing PCs faces, with or without names
   
**The spreadsheet is well-annotated with notes. Feel free to ask any questions here.**

## What features are currently planned?
 * Player tracker within map, with movement speed and distance calculation
 * Character sheet generator
 * More functional broadcast sheet, with FoW maps.
 

## Changelog
A detailed changelog is on the first sheet of the spreadsheet.

## TL;DR and download
[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByMhRbTvKiaCaEtydDNRdHdJOEk)'s the spreadsheet. The first sheet is a table of contents and guide. I recommend you clone it to your Google Drive and use it there. Works best when viewed with Google Sheets (It's mostly compatible with Excel, it just looks ugly).
